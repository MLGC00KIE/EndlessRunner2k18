Welcome player, Let's get you through the basics.

Move your mouse to control your ship.

Good.

Now let's test your reflections.

Once a wall appears try to move away at the very last moment.

Try again.

Great.

You now have one speed point!

Please, Don't get hit.
If you do, Take some time to recover the ship.
Wait until the indicators are full and then continue to gain speedpoints.

Once you have 10 speed points your ship will go faster.

You can also spend speed points in the store.

Please, collect as many as you can.

>Good luck, Player!
